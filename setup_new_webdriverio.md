## Create NodeJs project and all Webdriverio:

To add a full WebdriverIO setup to an existing or new project using the WebdriverIO Starter Toolkit, run:

Using NPM, If you're in the root directory of an existing project, run:

`npm init wdio .`
We need to have WebdriverIO CLI on our project,
https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wdio/cli
```
"devDependencies": {
    "@wdio/cli": "^7.16.12"
  }
```
